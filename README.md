# IPL_MATCH_ANALYSIS

We have always talked about the importance of first 6 overs, which are the power-play overs, in 20-20 cricket. 
Gayle storm, Kohli's drives, Rohit's pull shots, Brett Lee, Bumrah, Malinga, Raina's runout (oof), MSD's sixes (okay, I'm gonna stop now)

But this is where I got an idea (or rather a question), can you predict the result of a match just from the the scores of 1st 6 overs?
Turns out you can!

<h>DATA SET</h>
I got the data set from kaggle. It has 2 files, deliviries and matches. Matches has all the information starting from match no to the names of umpires. Deliviries has ball to ball information of every match.
